# mRNA Display Results Analysis
Provides a way to analyse and visualise the mRNA-display results based on next-generation-sequencing (NGS) data.

**sample_input** â€” data is from the original research. mRNA-display was performed against active biotin-tagged human recombinant PHD2 immobilised on M-280 streptavidin magnetic beads. cDNA library was assembled from five libraries combined at equimolar ratios with random region varying from (NNK)8 to (NNK)12 (cDNA total length varying from 111 to 123 nucleotides, respectively). Original library diversity was estimated 10<sup>12</sup>-10<sup>14</sup> unique cDNA sequences, each present at 1 to 100 copies.
